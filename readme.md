HETIC H4 Data design project
by Anouk Hervouet, Myriam Abidonn, Sibylle Hervouet and Zo√© Vincent

## Dataset
We choose this dataset : [https://www.kaggle.com/rahulgoel1106/hatred-on-twitter-during-metoo-movement](https://www.kaggle.com/rahulgoel1106/hatred-on-twitter-during-metoo-movement) which contains reactions on twitter following the #Metoo movement.

We took a sample of 100 data to make 2 graphical representations of the data: the megaphone and the display of tweets. This sample is available here in json format : [https://api.jsonbin.io/b/61fd01f04ce71361b8cde1a3](https://api.jsonbin.io/b/61fd01f04ce71361b8cde1a3).

## P5 template
We used Jules Fouchy's p5 template available here : [https://github.com/JulesFouchy/p5Template](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/p5Template).
